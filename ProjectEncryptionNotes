RSA notes
- create RSA object
- using sso library, generate public and private key
  - use public key to encrypt and private key to decrypt

Symmetric Keys
- create an AES object
  - generate a key of 256 bytes by downloading a Pseudo-RNG
  - generate two keys
    - use one for AES
    - use other for edge map

HMACKey [64b]
AESKey  [64b]

Encryption
RSAPlain = AESkey + Hmackey
RSA.defined(RSACipher, RSAPlain...)

Decryption
RSA.doFinal(RSAPlain, RSACipher...)
split(RSAPlain)
